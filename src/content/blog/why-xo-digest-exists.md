This is a demo post with XO chain frontmatter. When you view it on the site, the **Canonical chain** block below will show links to:

- **View in Vault** — the `vault_url` from frontmatter
- **View Ledger Day** — derived from `ledger_day` (or post date)
- **Merkle Proof** — same day on the ledger
- **PDF** — ledger day PDF
- **Digest JSON** and **Validate** — derived from the post date (or `digest_day`)

All of these URLs are computed at build time; no backend required.
